                My name is Angel Manson, I am a senior at Boston University
                studying Computer Science with a Business minor.
                With a lifelong passion for math, I have always known that
                I wanted to work in a math-heavy field. So after high school,
                I aimed for a career in Finance or Accounting, but a pivotal
                moment came when I enrolled in a Computer Science course at
                Boston University, urged by my mother. Instantly captivated
                by the subject, I found myself thriving in the challenging
                coursework, constantly feeling accomplished. This leap of
                faith reshaped my career aspirations, revealing my true
                passion for Computer Science. I am now driven to utilize
                my mathematical passion and newfound love for technology
                to make meaningful contributions within the field.
